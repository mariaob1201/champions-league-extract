Text excerpt: Undergrad freshman OOS, help me decide between UW Madison, Purdue and UT Austin for a CS track. Admission in UTA is in Informatics major and Madison is general engineering but Purdue is direct CS admit.

Heard good things about AI lab of Madison but heard Purdue has better internship opportunities due to its location. Reddit is not very kind on UTA informatics major so am kind of confused and need advice.

Thanks in advance!
