From what I can gather he was raised by his grandparents and his mum also demanded money from him when he was at Arsenal, but she couldnt claim anything because she didnt have custody over him. I think its the reason why he left Deportivo La Coruna (apparently he didnt feel supported there?) and while he had offers from multiple clubs, they 'were not like PSV'.

I mean if you live in their house beyond reaching adulthood or something than i would somewhat understand but this case or even the thought of it reads like a fever dream to me.

I know there are countries where the moral obligation to take care of your elderly parents is stronger and i'd imagine that if a country lacks state pensions that such obligations can even be translated in to law or case law. But last time i checked Spain was an EU country and i can't really imagine such thing. On top of that his parents never really cared for him it seems.

The Mother demanding money is even more wild but i'd assume she is/was just dumb and delousional. Not sure if she had help from a lawyer in writing that letter but if so that person should be kicked out of the profession for good. We should be harsher for entities demanding things withouth any conceivable ground.

* His parents left him in an orphanage at the age of two.
* His grandparents took care of him.
* His grandmother granted his father shared custody.
* When Lucas signed with Arsenal, his mother sent him a legal notice requesting money.
* In January 2023, Lucas pays 500.000‚Ç¨ to make his return to RC Deportivo possible. Going down from a La Liga team to Third Division.
* In December 2023, I√±aki Idiakez (RC Deportivo's manager) and √Ålex Berganti√±os (ex-Deportivo player, member of the board at that time) informed Lucas that some members of the board wanted to release him.
* Lucas felt betrayed after having made such an effort to sign for Deportivo.
* Lucas ends the season with 15 goals, 19 assists and scoring the goal that gets RC Deportivo promoted.
* In the first months of this year, his conflict with the club remained unresolved. He did not feel appreciated by some members of the board (Likely M. Benassi General Director and F. Soriano Sporting Director).
* December 2024, Lucas received a lawsuit from his father demanding a large sum of money, alimony his death.
* He spoke with the club about his situation and his weak mental state.
* The club sent him a commitment letter with a confidentiality clause (he doesn't say what exactly he was not allowed to speak about).
* Lucas felt betrayed, rejected the offer and decided to leave.
* He did not engage in discussions with any team from Madrid, contrary to what was reported. He moved to Madrid because his child lives there.
* To stay fit he trained with 3rd div Rayo Majadahonda. After seen him train, the players jokingly told him they were willing to contribute from their own pockets to pay his salary.
* On January 30, PSV contacted him and was willing to wait until he was in a better psychological state.
* He received offers from other clubs.

I mean this match was played in Doha and it was 18 degrees (64F if you're american). That's cool weather, not hot. Ahli play home games in Jeddah around 25-28C (80F) most winter evenings so fair enough it's hot there. But then you realise they play away games and most of those from Nov-Mar are pretty cool or chilly. Ahli played just last week in Sakakah and it was 8C/46F there.
