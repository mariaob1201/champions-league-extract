- GOOOOAAAAALLLLL!!!! 1-0 MANCHESTER CITY!! Grealish is found by Haaland, and he floats a clever pass into the path of Gvardiol who has burst into the box. He takes a touch with his chest and it falls to Haaland, and the clinical striker fires into the far corner! It's a superb move from Guardiola's side!

|21'| There was a lengthy VAR check to decide whether Haaland was in an offside position when Gvardiol chested it into his path. After a few minutes, the goal was confirmed, and the Etihad Stadium erupts again!|

- GOOOAAAAAALLLL!!! 1-1!! Real Madrid equalise! After Valverde's free-kick, Madrid's attack isn't over. Ceballos receives the ball and he plays an excellent floated pass over the top of the City defence. Mbappe strikes it on the volley, and the ball cannons off his shine, wrong-footing Ederson, before flying into the back of the net! Game on at the Etihad!

- GOOOAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLL!!! 2-2! Real Madrid equalise! It's a huge mistake from Ederson. The City goalkeeper tries to launch it forward, but he gives it straight to Bellingham. Vinicius is eventually found inside the box and fires at goal, but Ederson makes the save. It falls into the path of Diaz, and he fires into the back of the net against his former club!

- GOOOOAAAAALLLLL!!!! 1-0 MANCHESTER CITY!! Grealish is found by Haaland, and he floats a clever pass into the path of Gvardiol who has burst into the box. He takes a touch with his chest and it falls to Haaland, and the clinical striker fires into the far corner! It's a superb move from Guardiola's side!

- GOOOAAAAAALLLL!!! 1-1!! Real Madrid equalise! After Valverde's free-kick, Madrid's attack isn't over. Ceballos receives the ball and he plays an excellent floated pass over the top of the City defence. Mbappe strikes it on the volley, and the ball cannons off his shine, wrong-footing Ederson, before flying into the back of the net! Game on at the Etihad!

- GOOOAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLL!!! 2-2! Real Madrid equalise! It's a huge mistake from Ederson. The City goalkeeper tries to launch it forward, but he gives it straight to Bellingham. Vinicius is eventually found inside the box and fires at goal, but Ederson makes the save. It falls into the path of Diaz, and he fires into the back of the net against his former club!

- GOOOAAAAAAALLLLLLL!!! 1-0 REAL MADRID!! What a start! Asencio plays a sensational pass over the top of the Man City defence, and Dias fails to deal with it. It bounces and Mbappe gets on the end of it, and he lifts the ball over Ederson and into the goal! It's a superb finish and a nightmare start for Guardiola's men!

The Brazilian winger pokes it towards Mbappe, who chops inside - sending Gvardiol to ground - before firing into the bottom corner. What a sensational goal from the Spanish side!

- GOOAALLLLLL! 1-1! HAALAND RESTORES PARITY WITH A LOFTED HEADER OVER RAYA! Foden plays in Savinho and the Brazilian puts up a beautiful ball for Haaland to nod back across Raya after beating Saliba in the air! That's his 19th goal in the Premier League this season.

||||
|-------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|56'| ⚽ Goal! Arsenal [2], Manchester City 1. Thomas Partey (Arsenal) | [Highlight](https://old.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1ig2rw6/arsenal_2_1_manchester_city_thomas_partey_57/)
- GOOAAAALLL! 2-1! ARSENAL RETAKE THE LEAD 38 SECONDS AFTER THE RESTART! The Gunners come forward and respond excellently. A move culminates with Partey receiving the ball outside the box on the right. He shoots from range and it takes a nick to keep Ortega rooted and fly into the left side of the goal. That's the Ghanaian's third goal in the Premier League this season, netting for the first time since 23rd November 2024 against Nottingham Forest.

||||
|-------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|62'| ⚽ Goal! Arsenal [3], Manchester City 1. Myles Lewis-Skelly (Arsenal)| [Highlight](https://old.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1ig2x2d/arsenal_3_1_manchester_city_myles_lewisskelly_62/)
- GOOOAAALLL! 3-1 ARSENAL AND IT'S LEWIS-SKELLY! Rice feeds the youngster as he drives in from the left. The 18-year-old cuts inside of Stones and wraps a curling shot on goal. Ortega dives down to the right but can only put a hand on the ball as it whizzes in off the right post! That's Lewis-Skelly's first goal in the Premier League this term.

>Lewis-Skelly (18y 129d) is the youngest player to score against Manchester City in the PL since Lee Cattermole in April 2006 (18y 12d).

- GOOOAALLLL! HAVERTZ MAKES IT 4-1! The Gunners break in deadly fashion down the right as the reigning champions are caught cold. Martinelli flies on after being fed by Partey. Havertz goes for the overlap towards the right byline, then comes inside and strokes the ball home past a sprawling Ortega. That's a wonderful finish and no doubt a massive help for his confidence. That's his ninth goal in the Premier League this season, netting for the first time since 18th January 2025 against Aston Villa.

- GOOOOAAAAALLLLL!!!! 1-0 MANCHESTER CITY!! Grealish is found by Haaland, and he floats a clever pass into the path of Gvardiol who has burst into the box. He takes a touch with his chest and it falls to Haaland, and the clinical striker fires into the far corner! It's a superb move from Guardiola's side!

- GOOOAAAAAALLLL!!! 1-1!! Real Madrid equalise! After Valverde's free-kick, Madrid's attack isn't over. Ceballos receives the ball and he plays an excellent floated pass over the top of the City defence. Mbappe strikes it on the volley, and the ball cannons off his shine, wrong-footing Ederson, before flying into the back of the net! Game on at the Etihad!

I found [this post](https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/0281-18096ab833ba-60100b78b635-1000--most-champions-league-games-and-wins-as-a-coach/) by UEFA which states the 9 managers with the most wins in the CL (121 to 53 wins) and with the data, I have written down, I could easily find the managers who defeated the most of these 9. I will abbreviate the names in the 3rd column to save space. This is the order of most wins to fewest: Carlo, Pep, SAF, Wenger, Mou, LvG, Klopp, Cholo, Rafa.

|different coaches defeated - overall wins against them|Manager|Who did he defeat?|
|:-|:-|:-|
|6 - 19|Carlo Ancelotti|Pep, SAF, Wenger, Klopp, Cholo, Rafa|
|6 - 11|Jürgen Klopp|Carlo, Pep, Wenger, Mou, Cholo, Rafa|

|5 - 13|Pep Guardiola|Carlo, SAF, Wenger, Mou, Cholo|

Louis van Gaal only picked up 2 wins (1 vs SAF and Wenger).

As you can see Klopp, Ancelotti and Mourinho only had 2 managers missing (because they can't defeat their very self). I checked whether they faced the 2 missing managers in the CL:

Klopp never played against Ferguson and he also never met van Gaal in the CL, but 7x in BL, PL, EL (3-1-3 record).

Ancelotti obviously faced Mourinho because the latter has him on his list in the 3rd column, 2x in the CL, RO16 2009/10 Inter won both games vs Chelsea. The record in all comps is 4-1-4. This seems hard to believe because their eras overlapped a lot more than Klopp-Ferguson but Carlo never played against van Gaal in any competition.

Mourinho obviously faced Simeone because the latter has him on his list in the 3rd column, while we are at it there are also no doubts that he faced Wenger in his career lol. But we're interested in the Champions League only here: Mourinho-Simeone clashed 6 times, 2 of those in the CL, semi-final 2013/14, Atlético won a game and drew the other. Mourinho won all 3 LaLiga matchups v Simeone but lost the CdR final 2013. Mourinho-Wenger clashed 19 times and Wenger doesn't stand a chance at all in this comparison, José's record is 10-7-2. But unlucky for him, they never faced each other in the Champions League.

Tl;dr none of Klopp, Ancelotti and Mourinho had the possibility to defeat all of the other 8 managers because they didn't play against all of them in the CL.

Guardiola, who is missing 3 managers, only faced 1 of these 3 in the CL, Klopp by whom he got famously thrashed in the quarters 2017/18.

\--

None of these 9 coaches had lost 5 times in the CL against a certain coach, however there is one instance of a manager losing 6 times to another: Klopp's 6 losses to Ancelotti.

4 losses vs one manager: Wenger 4 losses to Guardiola, Guardiola losses to Ancelotti, Ancelotti losses to Ferguson, Ferguson losses to Hitzfeld.

It's a funny chain actually but not a circle because Wenger defeated Hitzfeld zero times, not 4x.

I looked up quite a few other managers' losses too and none of them lost more often than 4 times against the same manager. The only other 3 instances of 4 losses are: Lucescu 4 losses to Ancelotti, Lucescu losses to Guardiola, Pochettino losses to Guardiola.

3 losses against one manager (incuding my entire matrix):

Sir Alex Ferguson, Diego Simeone, Koeman 3 losses to Ancelotti; Mourinho, Allegri to Guardiola; Irureta to Sir Alex Ferguson; Klopp to Wenger; Wenger, Koeman to Benítez; Guardiola, Laurent Blanc to Luis Enrique; Leo Jardim to Allegri; Sir Alex Ferguson to Irureta; Irureta to Deschamps; Mircea Lucescu to Koeman.

There are a bit under 20 instances in my table where a manager beat another with 2 different clubs, but there occured just 1 where a manager defeated another with 3 different teams: Rafa Benítez won 3 CL games vs Arsène Wenger, 1 with Valencia, Liverpool, Napoli each. In the PL he also added a win with Chelsea and Newcastle vs Wenger's Arsenal. Despite that, Benítez has a negative H2H record 8-6-10.

The 2 most surprising examples of managers who have zero CL wins against these 9 managers are probably Roberto Mancini and Jorge Jesus. Most surprising because of everyon with zero win against the Top-9 these two had the most wins (4 and 5) against all of the other managers I have looked up.",soccer,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1im4mss/who_defeated_at_least_3_of_the_9_managers_with/

Out of curiosity, I thought I'd add up the final positions of each team's 8 opponents in the League phase to get a very rough estimate of how tough each team's fixture list turned out to be. Not sure it's super relevant from an analysis standpoint but I thought it was interesting enough to share anyway.

A few things I noticed while pulling it all together:

\- Villa didn't face a single team that finished above 12th in any of their 8 games

\- Stuttgart went out despite having the 2nd easiest schedule, being the only team with a top-10 easiest fixture list to exit the competition. Four of their 8 games were against sides that finished 29th or below

\- City's performance looks even worse here, having the 6th easiest fixture list and still only just making it through

\- Leverkusen made it to the Last 16 despite the 5th hardest schedule, playing 3 of the top 5

\- Real Madrid almost did the same with the 4th hardest schedule, with 4 of their games being against sides in the top 10

\- Of the 10 teams with the hardest schedules, 7 ended up being eliminated

1ij03nl,[OC] Which Champions League teams rotated their starting 11 the most/fewest in their CL and domestic league games?,57,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1ij03nl/oc_which_champions_league_teams_rotated_their/,2025-02-06 05:07:28,15,MERTENS_GOAT,"In which team was the higehst percentage of the starting spots across all league and CL games this season eaten up by the same 11 players? Which coach rotates the starting 11 the fewest (cup games aside)? This post will answer this question.

The formula is as simple as this: The Starts of the 11 players with the most starts for this team divided through the maxium number of possible starts. Hypothetical example for explanation: If a team played 17 league games, the amount of starting appearances for the 11 players with the most starts will be divided through 275 = (17+8)\*11. Let's say the 11 players who started the most often, all started in exactly 20 games, then it's (20\*11) / (25\*11) = 0.8 = 80 Percent

This is an objective analysis of numbers, it does not take into account injuries or any other subjective note. However, you will notice injuries play a much smaller role compared to managerial changes during the CL Group Stage or how important the league/CL is for the respective side.

Here's a to 97% full list of the CL teams (high in table --> low rotation):

|Percentage of Starts by the 11 most favored players|Club (Matchday after which manager was changed)|
|:-|:-|
|84.4|SL Benfica|
|79.7|FC Barcelona|

I am sorry for Slovan Bratislava but [fbref.com](http://fbref.com) doesn't track your league and I am not going into that hustle, if anyone wants to, feel free to do it and I will add them to the table.

The lowest figure for the player with the 11th most starts of a team comes from Dani Olmo. He started just 9 games, the player with the 10th most starts for Barça is however Iñaki Peña with 19 starts! And the next players in the ranking are even already at 24. Flick has an untouchable set of 9 outfield players where just 1 midfield spot was up for rotation so far.

The highest figure for the player with the 11th most starts of a team logically comes from Benfica with Di María. Even though Benfica only had 28 CL and league games so far, 21 starts only makes him the 11th highest picked player by his coaches. Benfica's next players in row have 14, 9 and 5 starts. For Atalanta it's the same figure with 21 starts for Pasalic and Bellanova who are tied-10th within the club. However, Atalanta played 31 games, 3 more than Benfica.

The highest figure of starts comes from Haaland, Emiliano Martínez, Tielemans, K. Schmeichel, Mechele, Mignolet who all started in all 32 games of their clubs. Other players who started all games (but their team had less than 32 so far) are F. Valverde, Maignan, Sommer, Chevalier, Kimmich, Trincão, Trubin, I. Paixão, Riznyk, Sudakov, Peter Vindahl Jensen.

The clubs where the number of starts by the most-often-started player is the furthest away from the possible maximum is Crvena zvezda where Nasser Djiga, who started the most games for them (even though, he plays for Wolves), still didn't start in 6 games (22 of 28).

Some teams signed more than 3 players, so problems are inevitable. This information isn't really given anywhere afaik, so you will usually need to look through squad for squad to see which winter signings made the cut and which didn't, so that's what I did:

**No Winter signings:**

**Arsenal, Barcelona, Liverpool, Atlético Madrid, Real Madrid.**

**The Top-8 Teams from the CL League Phase:**

**Inter:** Nicola Zalewski in

**Lille OSC:** Chuba Akpom in

**Bayer Leverkusen:** Mario Hermoso, Emiliano Buendía in; Alejo Sarco not in

**Aston Villa:** Axel Disasi, Marcus Rashford, Marco Asensio in; Donyell Malen not in

**Rank 9-24:**

**Manchester City:** Abdukodir Khusanov, Nico González, Omar Marmoush in; Vitor Reis, Claudio Echeverri, Christian McFarlane not in

**Paris Saint-Germain:** Khvicha Kvaratskhelia in

**Bayern München:** Gabriel Vidovic in over B-list, Jonas Urbig in

**Atalanta BC:** Stefan Posch, Daniel Maldini in

**Borussia Dortmund:** Daniel Svensson, Carney Chukwuemeka, Salih Özcan in

**Juventus:** Renato Veiga, Lloyd Kelly, Randal Kolo Muani in; Alberto Costa not in

**Club Brugge:** Vince Osuji in

**Sporting CP:** Rui Silva, Biel in

**Feyenoord:** Jakub Moder in; Stéphano Carrillo, Oussama Targhalline, Liam Bossin, Shiloh't Zand not in

**AS Monaco:** Mika Biereth, Al-Musrati in

**Stade Brestois:** Justin Bourgault not in

**SL Benfica:** Andrea Belotti, Samuel Dahl, Manu Silva in; Bruma not in

**PSV:** Esmir Bajraktarević, Tyrell Malacia in (also Ivan Perisic in, he was too late signed in the summer)

**AC Milan:** Kyle Walker, João Félix, Santiago Giménez in; Warren Bondo, Riccardo Sottil not in

**Celtic:** Johnny Kenny, Jota, Jeffrey Schlupp in.

I just added all new incomings listed on [transfermarkt.de](http://transfermarkt.de) I can't know for all the teams which players were signed for the 1st team and which not, so there was no point in starting to exclude any. I only ignored players who were promoted from the 2nd team because these can usually be listed on the B-List which isn't limited.",soccer,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1ik0l8z/an_overview_over_the_new_registered_winter/

- 2nd Half Starts!

||||
|-------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|45'| Rice gets this game back underway for the second half of action.|
|55'| ⚽Goal! Arsenal 1, Manchester City [1]. Erling Haaland (Manchester City)| [Highlight](https://old.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1ig2qbv/arsenal_1_1_manchester_city_erling_haaland_55/)
- GOOAALLLLLL! 1-1! HAALAND RESTORES PARITY WITH A LOFTED HEADER OVER RAYA! Foden plays in Savinho and the Brazilian puts up a beautiful ball for Haaland to nod back across Raya after beating Saliba in the air! That's his 19th goal in the Premier League this season.

||||
|-------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|56'| ⚽ Goal! Arsenal [2], Manchester City 1. Thomas Partey (Arsenal) | [Highlight](https://old.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1ig2rw6/arsenal_2_1_manchester_city_thomas_partey_57/)
- GOOAAAALLL! 2-1! ARSENAL RETAKE THE LEAD 38 SECONDS AFTER THE RESTART! The Gunners come forward and respond excellently. A move culminates with Partey receiving the ball outside the box on the right. He shoots from range and it takes a nick to keep Ortega rooted and fly into the left side of the goal. That's the Ghanaian's third goal in the Premier League this season, netting for the first time since 23rd November 2024 against Nottingham Forest.

||||
|-------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|62'| ⚽ Goal! Arsenal [3], Manchester City 1. Myles Lewis-Skelly (Arsenal)| [Highlight](https://old.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1ig2x2d/arsenal_3_1_manchester_city_myles_lewisskelly_62/)
- GOOOAAALLL! 3-1 ARSENAL AND IT'S LEWIS-SKELLY! Rice feeds the youngster as he drives in from the left. The 18-year-old cuts inside of Stones and wraps a curling shot on goal. Ortega dives down to the right but can only put a hand on the ball as it whizzes in off the right post! That's Lewis-Skelly's first goal in the Premier League this term.

>Lewis-Skelly (18y 129d) is the youngest player to score against Manchester City in the PL since Lee Cattermole in April 2006 (18y 12d).

- GOOOAALLLL! HAVERTZ MAKES IT 4-1! The Gunners break in deadly fashion down the right as the reigning champions are caught cold. Martinelli flies on after being fed by Partey. Havertz goes for the overlap towards the right byline, then comes inside and strokes the ball home past a sprawling Ortega. That's a wonderful finish and no doubt a massive help for his confidence. That's his ninth goal in the Premier League this season, netting for the first time since 18th January 2025 against Aston Villa.

The Rotterdammers are dealing with a total of ten injuries. Among those missing are Inbeom Hwang and Ayase Ueda. Feyenoord expects that four players will not return to action this season. 

On Tuesday evening at 18:45, Feyenoord will face AC Milan in the knockout round of the Champions League. The team, led by interim coach Pascal Bosschaart, will defend a 1-0 lead in San Siro. Calvin Stengs will return to the team on Tuesday after missing the last six matches for Feyenoord due to an injury. 

Bosschaart, however, will have to manage without Quinten Timber, who is still experiencing knee issues. Facundo González is on his way back but the return match against AC Milan comes too soon for him. Additionally, Feyenoord will miss Gernot Trauner, Ramiz Zerrouki, Hwang, and Ueda in the coming weeks. 

There are also the long-term injured players: Jordan Lotomba, Justin Bijlow, Chris-Kévin Nadje, and Bart Nieuwkoop. Feyenoord expects that these players will not return to action for the rest of the season.

Statement from our Board Member Fethi Pekin | We Ask the Football Public

Saturday, March 01, 2025 21:02

A referee who recently attended a referee seminar in our league with the nickname “The Greatest Galatasaray” will officiate the Galatasaray match tomorrow in the 26th week of the Super League.

Based on this fact, we are asking the public;

is it possible for this referee, whose identity as a fan the Turkish football public learned by chance, to officiate tomorrow’s match impartially?

Is this situation fair?

Is such a situation possible in any league in the world? What is the comment of the so-called justice guardian managers of this club

in the face of the confessions of a football player named Ryan Babel, who played for them in the past, that shook the agenda today, “The referees were helping us and we were getting the 3 points” ? In this environment where even a referee who has officiated the Champions League final and is among the most elite referees in the world with his career is being discussed for days, I am presenting these questions, which we have asked based on facts, to the attention of the entire public.

Santiago Giménez is now a reinforcement for the historic Milan in Italy’s Serie A.

Súper Deportivo can confirm, after consulting sources close to the negotiation, that Santi Giménez’s transfer from Feyenoord to Milan is finalized and will be officially announced in a matter of hours.

This outlet has learned that Milan agreed to pay €35 million for the transfer, though Feyenoord will retain a percentage of a future sale.

""Bebote"" is expected to arrive in Italy this Saturday to undergo medical exams and sign his contract.

Súper Deportivo also reports that the Mexican’s contract with Milan will run until June 2029.

Santiago Giménez’s Journey

After his time with Cruz Azul, where he won Liga MX, Campeón de Campeones, and the Supercopa de la Liga MX, the striker joined Feyenoord for the 2022-2023 season.

With the Dutch club, Giménez has scored 65 goals and won the Eredivisie (2023), KNVB Cup (2024), and the Dutch Super Cup (2024).

Milan will be Santiago Giménez’s second European club, as he looks to return to the Mexican National Team in March for the Concacaf Nations League Final Four.

Interestingly, in the UEFA Champions League Playoffs, Milan will face Feyenoord in February.

Milan’s Interest

Giménez has had a strong start to the year in the Eredivisie, scoring five goals in January, not only in the domestic league but also in the Champions League, where he netted a brace against Bayern Munich.

His impressive form caught the attention of Milan, now managed by Sérgio Conceição.

Notably, it was recently revealed that Zlatan Ibrahimović, Milan legend and now a club advisor, personally reached out to Bebote to convince him to sign, believing he would be a great addition to the squad.

""Giménez is a top talent with a lot of potential. We all know how good he is,"" said the Swede during Kyle Walker’s presentation.",soccer,https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1ifjxir/santiago_giménez_to_milan_the_details_of_the/

# The ""In Case You Missed It"" Thread - for all the highlights we *weren't* paying attention to...

r/soccer is often dominated by discussion around the Premier League, and the biggest European teams. This means other clubs and leagues can get overlooked. The idea for this thread is a ""second chance"" to share goals, highlights, and other news stories that may not have got their deserved spotlight this week.

There are just three rules (as well as all our others about shitposting, trolling etc)

1. No Premier League ""Super League Six"" teams (Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Man City, Man United, Spurs) **OR** Barcelona, Real Madrid, PSG or Bayern Munich
2. The original post must have had less than **1,000** upvotes when first posted on r/soccer (if posted at all)
3. If posting a highlight, ensure you share a link to the original r/soccer post, or another source

Carlo Ancelotti is stuck in a cycle he can’t escape from. He wins the UCL and gets knocked out of the Semi-Final the next season.

He won La Decima, got knocked out by Juventus.

Came back and won the UCL against Liverpool, got knocked out by Man city.

Won the UCL against Dortmund, and right on cue, Real Madrid are worse than they were last season. 

This also doesn’t just go for the UCL, it goes for all major titles. La liga, and Copa Del Rey. 

I am practically certain Liverpool will face Real Madrid in the Semi-Final and Liverpool will win, and Barcelona will win La Liga. However, I am uncertain who will win Copa Del Rey.

Imagine there are 4 games playing at the same time.

Obviously when your attention is splitted towards multiple games you can't focus fully. However I still feel need to at least keep the screen on for other games too.

So for me, maximum I can do is 3 games. 4 is too much.

1- Main TV screen with high volume, this is the game I focus the most

2- Smaller monitor near the TV with 20% volume. So during the main game I can still see whats going on and make the switch when necessary.

3- Laptop screen with %5 volume just for the sake of it. Most of the time I won't even look at this unless there is a goal or huge miss,  but yeah I still keep the screen open if there is a game I want to watch.

After Real Madrid, AC Milan is the most successful club in European history with 7 Champions League titles. 

In hockey, the 2nd most successful club is the Toronto Maple Leafs with 13 Stanley Cups. Despite not winning the title for over 40 years, the Toronto Maple Leafs are still amongst the richest and still draw the biggest players on the biggest salaries and have amongst the biggest media draw and media presence. Many would say the Toronto Maple Leafs are on par with the Montreal Canadiens as the ""biggest"" team.

  
In baseball, the 2nd most successful club after the New York Yankees is the St. Louis Cardinal with 11 World Series. Despite being the 2nd most successful club after the Yankees, the St. Louis Cardinals do not have the massive financial power and reach of the Yankees. Actually, the next ""biggest"" team after the Yankees is probably the Los Angeles Dodgers with mega financial power and mega media presence and media draw. One would say the St. Louis Cardinals are not on par with the Yankees.

  
So the question is: Is AC Milan more like the Toronto Maple Leafs or more like the St. Louis Cardinals?",championsleague,https://www.reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1isefbl/is_ac_milan_the_biggest_club_after_real_madrid/

the group stage, i didnt like but i dont mind it as i understand the argument that even the last match of the group stage can bring much drama and last minute table changes...

but the knockout round part, the draw, i watched the explanation video and i just shook my head. WTF. seriously. why can't they make it much simpler and just put all the darn balls in one bag and draw it that way, one by one? none of this seed garbage. you draw whoever you draw. FA cup style.

people may argue its to make some attractive matches, which means more money, but the way it was done it almost appears rigged.

am i alone on this? i appreciate some may even want the old-fashioned european cup knockout format - i wouldnt mind that at all, though sadly thats highly unrealistic now...

PS. ANYONE but real madrid to win the champions league please. i dont care who. i  am so sick of seeing RM winning it all the time. it gets boring.",championsleague,https://www.reddit.com/r/championsleague/comments/1iy153u/that_draw_made_absolutely_no_sense/

This guy arrived on the international scene at 17-18 years old with Monaco, he won the Kopa Trophy and Golden Boy then won the World Cup at 19, since the beginning of his career, it will be more than 6 seasons in a row that he scores 40 goals or more not to mention his performances at the 2022 World Cup, 8 goals, a hat-trick in the final, I have never seen someone walk and show his dominance on a World Cup since R9 in 2002. More than 500G/A at only 26 years old and still no Ballon d'Or or major individual award like the European Golden Shoe! Wow.  Personally I think he doesn't have a Ballon d'Or because of PSG/Ligue 1, it's a less radiant championship than the others but above all Mbappé has never won the Champions League, I think he should have gone to England or Spain at 21 or 22, he would have increased his chances. In any case I hope this year will be the right one for him
